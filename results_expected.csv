curli are cell surface amyloid proteins abundantly expressed by certain gut bacteria. in mice overexpressing the human amyloid α-synuclein (αsyn), we reveal that colonization with curli-producing escherichia coli promotes αsyn pathology in the gut and the brain. curli expression is required for e. coli to exacerbate αsyn-induced behavioral deficits, including intestinal and motor impairments. purified curli subunits accelerate αsyn aggregation in biochemical assays, while oral treatment of mice with a gut-restricted amyloid inhibitor prevents curli-mediated acceleration of pathology and behavioral abnormalities."

470,"a container provides about 2 1/2 ounces of food. the base component is oatmeal, and they add in almonds, pistachios, and cherries. note that this means the flavor will be a bit sour, from the cherries. some people are ok with this. others won't enjoy it. so this is definitely something you should try first before you buy a twelve pack of it. it might be perfect for you - or the flavor might not be one you enjoy.we did like the flavor, and we liked the fresh ingredients. but, that being said, the price on amazon is over $2 a serving, which is fairly expensive. ""regular"" oatmeal can be 50 cents a packet or even less. you could easily customize that oatmeal to be exactly the way you want.but of course, many people are so pressed for time that they only have coffee for breakfast. that is really unhealthy. many studies show that you should start the day with a meal of some sort, to give your body the nutrients it needs to metabolize properly until lunch. so if you're currently eating nothing at all, and a better breakfast just isn't possible with your schedule, then at least this instant-eat meal is a better solution.nutrition wise, again this isn't great but it's certainly better than what many people eat (or don't eat) for breakfast. 290 calories, 8g fat, 180mg sodium, and a whopping 49g of carbs. sure, 5g of that is fiber, but a large 19g of that is sugar. that's a lot of sugar to be pouring into your mouth the first thing in the day. you also get 9g protein. in terms of vitamins, you barely get anything.so overall i'd always suggest eating something healthy for breakfast. something with protein, nutrition, and what your body actually needs to get its muscles and blood working properly. something with vitamin and minerals. so i do consider this a step up from many options - but i also consider it a stepping stone to help you get to a place where you eat a fresh meal, vs a sweetened, processed option.i was provided a review set of this from the amazon vine program. answernotfound"

995," dam identification (damid) system induced by cre recombinase using lamin b1 and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. this inducible system will help to generate genome-wide profiles of chromatin proteins in given cell types and tissues with no need to dissect tissues from organs or separate cells from tissues, which is achieved by using specific regulatory dna elements and due to the high sensitivity of the method. dna adenine methyltransferase identification (damid) has emerged as one of the most comprehensive and versatile methods available for profiling protein-dna interactions on a genomic scale.  recently, a novel methylation-based tagging technique, termed damid (dna adenine methyltransferase identification), has emerged as a powerful tool to decipher transcriptional networks, to study chromatin-associated proteins, and to monitor higher-order chromatin organization on a genome-wide scale. we show here that the in vivo methylation-based tagging technique damid (dna adenine methyltransferase identification) can be used for studies of dna-protein interactions or chromatin profiling in plants damid is a powerful method used to map the genomic interaction sites of these proteins in vivo  it is based on fusing a protein of interest to escherichia coli dna adenine methyltransferase (dam). expression of this fusion protein in vivo leads to preferential methylation of adenines in dna surrounding the native binding sites of the dam fusion partner. because adenine methylation does not occur endogenously in most eukaryotes, it provides a unique tag to mark protein interaction sites. dna adenine methyltransferase identification (damid) is an enzymatic technology for detecting dna regions targeted by chromatin-associated proteins.  overall, damid is highly robust: while the orientation of wt dam fusions can affect the size of the target sets, their signatures remained largely reproducible.

critically examining domain covariation across metagenomic datasets can grant new perspectives on the roles and associations of dufs in an ecological setting. targeted attempts at duf characterization in the laboratory or in silico may draw from these insights and opportunities to discover new associations and corroborate existing ones will arise as more large-scale metagenomic datasets emerge.

2203,"bioelectrical signals generated by ion channels play crucial roles in many cellular processes in both excitable and nonexcitable cells. some ion channels are directly implemented in chemical signaling pathways, the others are involved in regulation of cytoplasmic or vesicular ion concentrations, ph, cell volume, and membrane potentials. together with ion transporters and gap junction complexes, ion channels form steady-state voltage gradients across the cell membranes in nonexcitable cells. these membrane potentials are involved in regulation of such processes as migration guidance, cell proliferation, and body axis patterning during development and regeneration. while the importance of membrane potential in stem cell maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation is evident, the mechanisms of this bioelectric control of stem cell activity are still not well understood, and the role of specific ion channels in these processes remains unclear. the flatworm macrostomum lignano is a versatile model organism for addressing these topics. experimental tools have been developed which demonstrate how manipulation of membrane potential influences regeneration in m. lignano."

2283,"systemic administration of an nk3r antagonist (esn364) prolongs the lh interpulse interval in ovarectomized ewes and significantly lowers plasma lh and fsh concentrations in castrated nonhuman primates (macaca fascicularis). moreover, daily oral dosing of esn364 throughout the menstrual cycle in m fascicularis lowered plasma estradiol levels in a dose-dependent manner, although nadir levels of estradiol were maintained well above menopausal levels. nevertheless, estradiol levels during the follicular phase were sufficiently inhibited at all doses to preclude the triggering of ovulation as evidenced by the absence of the lh surge and failure of a subsequent luteal phase rise in plasma progesterone concentrations, consistent with the absence of normal cycle changes in the uterus. apart from the point at surge, fsh levels were not altered over the course of the menstrual cycle. these effects of esn364 were reversible upon cessation of drug treatment.

esn364 was well-tolerated and rapidly bioavailable with linear pharmacokinetics and no drug accumulation with repeated, daily oral administration. drug treatment dose-dependently decreased basal lh, but not fsh, and consequently decreased estradiol and progesterone (in women) as well as testosterone (in men). the hormonal changes in women corresponded to delayed ovulation, decreased endometrial thickening, impeded follicular maturation, and prolongation of the menstrual cycle. drug effects were rapidly reversible. oral administration of the nk3r antagonist, esn364, suppressed the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in healthy volunteers by selective modulation of gonadotropin secretion, leading to a restrained decrease in ovarian hormone levels in women. these results suggest that esn364 may offer therapeutic benefit in the treatment of women's health disorders with a mitigated risk of menopausal-like adverse events."

2610,"the major goal within the field of cardiovascular regenerative medicine is to replace lost or damaged cardiac muscle and coronaries following ischaemic disease. at present, de novo cardiomyocytes can be generated either in vitro, using directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells, or in vivo via direct reprogramming of resident adult cardiac fibroblast or ectopic stimulation of resident cardiac stem or progenitor cells. the production of human cardiac progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells provides an amenable source of cells for applications in drug discovery, disease modeling, regenerative medicine, and cardiotoxicity screening. in addition, the ability to derive human-induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic tissues, combined with current high-throughput screening and pharmacogenomics, may help realize the use of these cells to fulfill the potential of personalized medicine. human induced pluripotent stem cells (ipsc) provide a unique opportunity to study ""disease in a dish"" within a defined genetic and environmental background. patient-derived ipscs have been successfully used to model cardiomyopathies, rhythm disorders and vascular disorders. long-qt syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia are two heart rhythm disorders that have been already successfully modeled by several groups using this approach, which will likely serve to model other mono- or polygenetic cardiovascular disorders in the future. the use of ipsc-derived cardiomyocytes to study genetic cardiovascular disorders will enable a deeper and more applicable understanding of the molecular mechanisms of human disease, as well as improving our ability to achieve successful cell-based therapies."

instead, such mdr pumps are encoded within the genomes of virtually all microorganisms, so these genes are present and thus need only to be activated to become problematic. moreover, lateral transfer of genes among bacteria has occurred frequently, particularly for plasmid-encoded systems, suggesting that such genes can be acquired fairly readily even if they are not initially present. finally, although mutations that enable transporters to act on different types of substrate are rare, experiments and phylogenetic analyses indicate that simple point mutations can readily narrow or broaden a particular transporter's specificity toward a single class of compounds (e.g., sugars, amino acids, or drugs)."

-from human to human by the mosquito aedes aegypti; which is well-adapted to breeding around human habitations; the infection can be maintained in this way as ‘urban’ yellow fever.
-from infected monkeys to humans by mosquitoes such as haemagogus. this is ‘jungle’ yellow fever and is seen in africa and south america.

6290,"one approach that can facilitate a targeted assessment of candidate proteins, as well as proteins that are low in abundance or proteomically challenging, is by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. redox-modified cysteine residues are selectively tagged with a large group, such as a polyethylene glycol (peg) polymer, and then the proteins are separated by electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting, which allows the inference of redox changes based on band shifts. however, the applicability of this method has been impaired by the difficulty of cleanly modifying protein thiols by large peg reagents. to establish a more robust method for redox-selective pegylation a click chemistry approach has been developed where free thiol groups are first labelled with a reagent modified to contain an alkyne moiety, which is subsequently click-reacted with a peg molecule containing a complementary azide function. this strategy can be adapted to study reversibly reduced or oxidised cysteines. separation of the thiol labelling step from the peg conjugation greatly facilitates the fidelity and flexibility of this approach."

6997,"patatin, the major protein found in potatoes, was purified and shows several isoforms. the essential amino acid content of patatin was ashighas 76%, indicating that it is a valuable protein source. patatin was an o-linked glycoprotein that contained fucose monosaccharides, as well as mannose, rhamnose, glucose, galactose, xylose, and arabinose. patatin had a fucosylated glycan structural feature, which strongly bound aal (aleuria aurantia leukoagglutinin), a known fucose binding lectin. moreover, thelipid metabolism regulatory effects of patatin on the fat catabolism, fat absorption, and inhibition of lipase activity were measured after high-fat feeding of zebrafish larvae. results revealed that 37.0 μg/ml patatin promoted 23% lipid decomposition metabolism. meanwhile patatin could inhibite lipase activity and fat absorption, whose effects accounted for half that of a positive control drug. our findings suggest that patatin, a fucosylated glycoprotein, could potentially be used as a naturalactiveconstituent with anti-obesity effects."

phylogenetic analysis examines small differences in hiv’s genes using computational methods to calculate the genetic distance between strains. unlike
human dna, which remains stable for a lifetime, hiv’s rna changes very rapidly, leading to a huge amount of genetic diversity. this diversity means that scientists, using phylogenetic analysis, have been able to ascertain where hiv comes from, as well as track the various strains of hiv that exist worldwide.

7280,"drug-induced gingival overgrowth (go) is a frequent and adverse side-effect associated principally with the administration of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin a (csa) and also certain anti-epileptic and anti-hypertensive drugs. it is characterized by a marked increase in the thickness of the epithelial layer and the accumulation of excessive amounts of connective tissue.  keratinocyte growth factor (kgf), which is a potent epithelial cell mitogen that has been implicated in other hyperplastic conditions could be involved in the molecular pathology of go. also, since cathepsin-l deficiency was reported to be associated with thickening of the skin, impaired cathepsin-l activity may play a key role in the establishment of skin and gingival abnormalities seen in i-cell disease. in addition, reduced cathepsin-l activity may play an important role in inducing drug-induced gingival overgrowth. furthermore, the enhanced proliferation of gingival fibroblasts observed in this disease could be caused at least partly by the effects of the drugs on the cell cycle and cyclin expression in these cells. the increase in cell growth that occurs in drug-induced gingival overgrowth may be mediated by over-expression of cyclin b1."

7667,"an unusual feature of the diptera is that homologous chromosomes are intimately synapsed in somatic cells. at a number of loci in drosophila, this pairing can significantly influence gene expression. such influences were first detected within the bithorax complex (bx-c) by e.b. lewis, who coined the term transvection to describe them. most cases of transvection involve the action of enhancers in trans. at several loci deletion of the promoter greatly increases this action in trans, suggesting that enhancers are normally tethered in cis by the promoter region. transvection can also occur by the action of silencers in trans or by the spreading of position effect variegation from rearrangements having heterochromatic breakpoints to paired unrearranged chromosomes. although not demonstrated, other cases of transvection may involve the production of joint rnas by trans-splicing. several cases of transvection require zeste, a dna-binding protein that is thought to facilitate homolog interactions by self-aggregation. genes showing transvection can differ greatly in their response to pairing disruption. in several cases, transvection appears to require intimate synapsis of homologs. however, in at least one case (transvection of the iab-5,6,7 region of the bx-c), transvection is independent of synapsis within and surrounding the interacting gene. the latter example suggests that transvection could well occur in organisms that lack somatic pairing. in support of this, transvection-like phenomena have been described in a number of different organisms, including plants, fungi, and mammals."

7858,"breast cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the breast become abnormal and multiply without control or order to form a tumor. the most common form of breast cancer begins in cells lining the ducts that carry milk to the nipple (ductal cancer). other forms of breast cancer begin in the glands that produce milk (lobular cancer) or in other parts of the breast.
early breast cancer usually does not cause pain and may exhibit no noticeable symptoms. as the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include a lump or thickening in or near the breast; a change in the size or shape of the breast; nipple discharge, tenderness, or retraction (turning inward); and skin irritation, dimpling, or scaliness. these changes can occur as part of many different conditions, however. having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a person definitely has breast cancer.
in some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. if breast cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the bones, liver, lungs, or brain. tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers.
a small percentage of all breast cancers cluster in families. hereditary cancers are those associated with inherited gene mutations. hereditary breast cancers tend to occur earlier in life than noninherited (sporadic) cases and are more likely to involve both breasts.

variations of the brca1, brca2, brct, and p53 genes increase the risk of developing breast cancer.
